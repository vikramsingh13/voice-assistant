# HeadAudio

### Introduction

HeadAudio is an audio worklet node/processor for audio-driven,
real-time viseme detection and lip-sync in browsers. It uses
MFCC feature vectors and Gaussian prototypes with
a Mahalanobis-distance classifier. As output, it generates
Oculus viseme blend-shape values in real time and can be
integrated into an existing 3D animation loop.

- **Pros**: Audio-driven lip-sync works with any audio stream
or TTS output without requiring text transcripts or timestamps.
It is fast, fully in-browser, and requires no server.

- **Cons**: Voice activity detection (VAD) and prediction accuracy
are far from optimal, especially when the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) is low. In general, the audio-driven approach is
less accurate and computationally more demanding than
[TalkingHead](https://github.com/met4citizen/TalkingHead)'s
text-driven approach.

The solution is fully compatible with the
[TalkingHead](https://github.com/met4citizen/TalkingHead).
It doesn't have any external dependencies, and it is
MIT licensed.

[HeadTTS](https://github.com/met4citizen/HeadTTS),
[webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack),
and [jest](https://jestjs.io) were used during
development, training, and testing.

The implementation has been tested with the latest
versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari desktop
browsers, as well as on iPad/iPhone.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The model's accuracy will hopefully improve over time.
However, since all audio processing occurs fully in-browser
and in real time, it will never be perfect and may not be
suitable for all use cases. Some precision will always need
to be sacrificed to stay within the real-time processing budget.

### Using the HeadAudio Worklet Node/Processor

The steps needed to setup and use HeadAudio:

1. Import the Audio Worklet Node `HeadAudio` from
`"./modules/headaudio.mjs"`. Alternatively, use
the minified version `"./dist/headaudio.min.mjs"`
or a CDN build.

2. Register the Audio Worklet Processor from
`"./modules/headworklet.mjs"`. Alternatively, use
the minified version `"./dist/headworklet.min.mjs"`
or a CDN build.

3. Create a new `HeadAudio` instance.

4. Load a pre-trained viseme model containing Gaussian
prototypes, e.g., `"./dist/model-en-mixed.bin"`.

5. Connect your speech audio node to the HeadAudio node.
The node has a single mono input and does not output
any audio.

6. Optional: To compensate for processing latency (50–100 ms),
add delay to your speech-audio path using the browser's standard
[DelayNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DelayNode).

7. Assing `onvalue` callback function `(key, value)`
that updates your avatar's blend shape `key` (Oculus viseme name, e.g, "viseme_aa")
to the given `value` in the range \[0,1].

8. Call the node's `update` method inside your 3D animation
loop, passing the delta time (in milliseconds).

9. Optional: Set up any additional user event handlers as needed.

Here is a simplified code example using the above steps with a
[TalkingHead](https://github.com/met4citizen/TalkingHead)
class instance `head`:

```javascript
// 1. Import
import { TalkingHead } from "talkinghead";
import { HeadAudioNode } from "./modules/headaudio.mjs";

// 2. Register processor
const head = new TalkingHead( /* Your normal parameters */ );
await head.audioCtx.audioWorklet.addModule("./modules/headworklet.mjs");

// 3. Create new HeadAudio node
const headaudio = new HeadAudio(head.audioCtx, {
  processorOptions: { },
  parameterData: {
    vadGateActiveDb: -40,
    vadGateInactiveDb: -60
  }
});

// 4. Load a pre-trained model
await headaudio.loadModel("./dist/model-en-mixed.mjs");

// 5. Connect TalkingHead's speech gain node to HeadAudio node
head.audioSpeechGainNode.connect(headaudio);

// 6. OPTIONAL: Add some delay between gain and reverb nodes
const delayNode = new DelayNode( head.audioCtx, { delayTime: 0.1 });
head.audioSpeechGainNode.disconnect(head.audioReverbNode);
head.audioSpeechGainNode.connect(delayNode);
delayNode.connect(head.audioReverbNode);

// 7. Register callback function to set blend shape values
headaudio.onvalue = (key,value) => {
  Object.assign( head.mtAvatar[ key ],{ newvalue: value, needsUpdate: true });
};

// 8. Link node's `update` method to TalkingHead's animation loop
head.opt.update = headaudio.update.bind(headaudio);

// 9. OPTIONAL: Take eye contact and make a hand gesture when new sentence starts
let lastEnded = 0;
headaudio.onended = () => {
  lastEnded = Date.now();
};

headaudio.onstarted = () => {
  const duration = Date.now() - lastEnded;
  if ( duration > 150 ) { // New sentence, if 150 ms pause (adjust, if needed)
    head.lookAtCamera(500);
    head.speakWithHands();
  }
};
```

`vadGateInactiveMs` | Duration (ms) required before switching from active to inactive. | `10`
`silMode` | `0` = Disabled, `1` = Manual calibration, `2` = Auto (NOT IMPLEMENTED). If disabled, only trained SIL prototypes are used. In manual mode, the app must perform silence calibration. Auto mode is currently not implemented. | `1`
`silCalibrationWindowSec` | Silence-calibration window in seconds. | `3.0`
`silSensitivity` | Sensitivity to silence. | `1.2`
`speakerMeanHz` | Estimated speaker mean frequency in Hz [50–500]. Adjusting this gently stretches/compresses the Mel spacing and frequency range to better match the speaker’s vocal-tract resonances and harmonic structure.

### Training

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You do NOT need to train your own model as a pre-trained
model is provided. However, if you want to train a custom model,
the process below describes how the existing model was created.

The lip-sync model `./models/model-en-mixed.bin` was trained with four 
[HeadTTS](https://github.com/met4citizen/HeadTTS) voices using
[Harvard Sentences](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/audio/harvard.html)
as input text. HeadTTS is ideal for generating training data because
it can produce audio, phonemes, visemes, and highly accurate
phoneme-level timestamps.

1. Install and start HeadTTS text-to-speech REST service
locally (requires Node.js v20+):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/met4citizen/HeadTTS
cd HeadTTS
npm install
npm start
```

Note: Before using the HeadTTS server, download all the voices
that you will be using from
[onnx-community/Kokoro-82M-v1.0-ONNX-timestamped](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/Kokoro-82M-v1.0-ONNX-timestamped)
to your HeadTTS `./voices` directory.

2. Generate training data (.wav and .json)

In a separate console window, install HeadAudio (if you haven't already),
then generate the training files from the text prompts (.txt):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/met4citizen/HeadAudio
cd HeadAudio
npm install
cd training
node precompile-headtts.mjs -i "./headtts/headtts-1.txt" -v "af_bella"
node precompile-headtts.mjs -i "./headtts/headtts-2.txt" -v "af_heart"
node precompile-headtts.mjs -i "./headtts/headtts-3.txt" -v "am_adam"
node precompile-headtts.mjs -i "./headtts/headtts-4.txt" -v "am_fenrir"
```

Each voice takes about 2 minutes to process and generates roughly
10 minutes of training audio (.wav) along with corresponding
phoneme/viseme timestamp data (.json).

For Mahalanobis classification with 12 features, you should aim
for at least 60–120 samples per phoneme. The process above will
generate more than enough training data.

3. Compile the Gaussian prototypes into a binary model

Once the .wav and .json files are ready, build the final model (.bin):

```bash
node compile.mjs -i "./headtts" -o "model-en-mixed.bin"
```

Compilation takes about 30 seconds, and the resulting
binary file will be approximately 14 kB.

For all console apps, use the `--help` option to view
available arguments.

### Technical Overview

The viseme-detection process uses Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficient (MFCC) feature vectors, Gaussian prototypes, and a
[Mahalanobis distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance)
classifier.

Since only the relative ordering of distances matters,
the squared Mahalanobis distance $d_M^2$ is used:

$\displaystyle\qquad d_{M}^2 = (\vec{x} - \vec{\mu})^\top \Sigma^{-1} (\vec{x} - \vec{\mu})$

The real-time processing steps are as follows:

- **Audio input**: The audio worklet processor receives
real-time speech input on a dedicated audio thread.
The incoming audio typically consists of 128 mono float-32
samples at 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz.

- **Pre-emphasis and downsampling**:
A pre-emphasis filter is applied to emphasize high-frequency
components, after which the signal is downsampled to
16 kHz using a polyphase low-pass filter.

- **MFCC feature vector**: The downsampled audio is
processed in 512-sample frames with a 256-sample hop.
Each frame is converted into MFCC features through the
following steps:
(1) Apply a Hamming window,
(2) Compute the FFT,
(3) Calculate the power spectrum,
(4) Apply Mel filters,
(5) Perform a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).
The output is a normalized log-energy value and
a 12-coefficient MFCC feature vector.

- **Compression**:
MFCC features are compressed using `tanh` to improve robustness
across speakers and recording conditions.
If `feature` events are enabled, each feature vector is posted
to the main thread via `onfeature`.

- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: A simple gate-based
VAD model determines active vs. inactive speech based on
energy thresholds.
If `vad` events are enabled, active/inactive status and dB value
are posted to the main thread via `onvad`.

- **Classification**: Each pre-trained Gaussian prototype contains
a mean vector $\vec{\mu}$ and an inverse covariance matrix
$\Sigma^{-1}$ for a given phoneme. The classifier computes the
Mahalanobis distance for each prototype and selects the viseme
with the lowest distance. The result is posted to the main thread.
If the `viseme` events are enabled, the viseme, MFCC vector,
and the distance array are sent via `onviseme`.

- **Lip animation**: Based on the detected viseme, lip movements
are calculated with easing and blending/cross-fading.
Real-time blend-shape values are delivered via the `onvalue`
callback, using the Oculus morph-target name and the computed value.

### Appendix B: Data Structures

Models such as `./dist/model-en-mixed.bin` are binary files.
Each model contains multiple Gaussian prototypes, typically
one or more per viseme ID.

The byte layout of each prototype within the `.bin` file
is as follows:

Field | Length in bytes | Description
--- | --- | ---
phoneme | 4 | IPA phoneme stored as 1–2 UTF-16 characters.
N/A | 1 | Reserved for future use.
group | 1 | Group ID
N/A | 1 | Reserved for future use.
viseme | 1 | Viseme ID as an unsigned integer.
$\vec{\mu}$ | 12 * 4 | Mean feature vector (12 × float-32).
$\Sigma^{-1}$ | 78 * 4 | Lower-triangular part of the inverse covariance matrix (78 × float-32).

The file structure of each JSON (.json) viseme data is the following:

```json
[
  {
    "section": "A word or sentence", // the word/sentence (optional)
    "ps": [ // Phonemes
      {
        "p": "ɪ", // Phoneme, 1-2 letters
        "v": 0, // Viseme ID
        "t": 100, // Start time (ms)
        "d": 50  // Duration (ms)
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  {
    // Next word/sentence
  }
]
```

---

### Appendix C: Performance

In theory, the processing window for each 128-sample
audio block is 2.9 ms at 44.1 kHz or 2.7 ms at 48 kHz.
However, we must allow generous headroom for overhead,
jitter, CPU spikes, and lower-end hardware. If we don't,
the browser will begin dropping audio frames.

In practice, the processing should finish within 15-20%
of the block duration. In our test environment<sup>[1]</sup>,
we targeted a typical execution time of < 0.4 ms.

Below are measurement results for real-time processing inside
the HeadAudio processor:

Step | Duration<sup>\[1]</sup> | Notes
--- | --- | ---
MFCC/FFT | 0.025 ms | Computes a single MFCC feature vector (including FFT) from a 512-sample frame.
Classifier | 0.005 ms | Computes a viseme prediction by evaluating Mahalanobis distances against 50 Gaussian prototypes.
Processor | ~0.035 ms | Total time to process one 128-sample block (MFCC/FFT + classification). Represents typical peak values during a 21-second speech test (44.1 kHz mono).
**TOTAL** | **<0.1 ms** | **Estimated max processing time per 128-sample block for 99.9% of frames.**

Analysis of test-run statistics:

<img src="images/processor.png" width="500"/>

Assuming processing time per prediction ~0.5 ms,
MFCC/FFT window size: 512 samples @ 16 kHz,
hop size: 256 samples @ 16 kHz,
and requiring three consecutive identical predictions before changing viseme,
the total end-to-end latency is approximately 50 ms.

Training performance:

Training step | Duration<sup>\[1]</sup> | Notes
--- | --- | ---
Prototype | 0.286 ms | Computes one Gaussian prototype from 1000 MFCC vectors.
**TOTAL** | **<30 s** | **Training 50 prototypes including audio processing.**
